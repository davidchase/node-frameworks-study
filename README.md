node-frameworks-study
=====================

Testing out different node frameworks to see which works best.

Frameworks:
-----------

[Loopback:](http://loopback.io/) Open API Framework for Node.js
- Easy to create API restfully.
- Good for CRUD based apps and model driven.
- A bit of a learning curve.

[Sails:](http://sailsjs.org) API-driven framework for building realtime apps, using MVC conventions (based on Express and Socket.io)
- Very modular, can be good but also bad if the modules have no cohesion.
- Seems to need to be configured quite a bit to just use gulp with no grunt deps.
- Need to use Edge or Unstable version in order to use to full extent.
- Easy to create a model based API.

[Totaljs:](http://totaljs.com) Free web application framework for building Web sites and Web applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Node.js (MVC) web application framework
- Standalone not built on express.
- Could be not as fast as its counterparts from a benchmarking standpoint.
- Actively maintained. 

[Feathers:](http://feathersjs.com/) An ultra scalable, feather weight, data oriented framework
- Built on express with extra features such as socket.io and data-driven services.
- Still have to deal with express API, due to the fact that its a simple wrapper over it.

[Hapi:](http://hapijs.com/) A rich framework for building applications and services.
- Mature, and actively maintained, similar to express but more robust.
- The different API features are digestible and easy to comprehend.
- Easy to get started with and using vast features.
- Good for scaling.

[Express:](http://expressjs.com/)A minimal and flexible node.js web application framework
- Version 4x exports middlewares, etc to others aka third-party vendors.
- Modular, mature, maintained and fast.
- Other libraries build on top of express to extend its features.
